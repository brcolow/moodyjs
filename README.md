An implementation of the "Moody Method" for surface plate flatness.

[Try It](https://brcolow.github.io/moodyjs/)

## TODO

* Add a way to show a semi-transparent plane that corresponds to grade "AA", "A", and "B" flatness. tolerance(AA) =  (40 + diagonal squared/25) x .000001â€³, A = tolerance(AA) * 2, B=tolerance(AA) * 4
* Show a scale for the z-axis height values.
* Add a thickness for the table slab (add manufacturer's label).
